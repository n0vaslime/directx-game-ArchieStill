=== THE STORY OF LORD KAZCRANAK ===

Once upon a time, the young Jimmy Kazcranak yearned to be strong, but alas, he was weak.
He trained every day before uncovering the legend of Goldedge, a sword of immense power.
But one day, the Golden Hero stepped up and proved themselves worthy of Goldedge.
Jimmy was furious. HE was supposed to take Goldedge, not this Golden Fool!!!
He left in anger, harnessed the dark arts, and created an evil replica of Goldedge: dubbing it Darkedge!
He then created the Cube Minions, making sure no-one was to disturb him.

One day, after the events of 'Goldedge 1'TM, the Golden Hero left Badlandia.
They went searching for more adventure, but Jimmy, now Lord Kazcranak, found them!
He sealed the Golden Hero away for a thousand years out of rage.
And thus, the world thought that its greatest hero had simply vanished...

A millennia has passed.
After so long with immense power, Lord Kazcranak yearned for nothing more than a true battle.
He placed signs along the way to his sanctum in the sky, guiding the Golden Hero once they awoke.
All so they could do battle one final time... for the fate of the world!
